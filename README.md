# Staff
This contains all the needed information for how to be an effective staff member.

# General responsibilities
## Interacting on main
As Staff, you are expected to interact with other people, troops and staff alike, on main chat.

### Conversation
- Don't let any troop feel ignored. 
  - Make sure to say hi/bye to troops when they leave.
- Figure out what people are already talking about and join in. If it's appropriate, of course.
  - If not, change the subject.
- -topic is great for chat revival.
- If talking to a specifc troop, check mutual servers for potential conversation topics.
  - Ex: If they're also in Halo, we can talk about that. 
  
### Muting
- The syntax for muting is !mute username length of time reason (optional)
  - Ex: !mute @Blushock 5m spamming
- Give plenty of warning before you mute. Make sure you ping the offender so that they get the message.
  - Please be respectful.
  - Don't spam.
  - Please be nice.
- Always mute on a timer. As humans, we are naturally forgetful, and doing so on a timer works around this.
  - Start small, increase for repeat offenders. If it gets bad enough or happens enough times, let a trusted or above know and they will kick or ban

## Recruiting
Recruiting is our primary method of increasing the size of the server. As such, making yourself a standout recruiter will bring great fortune your way.

### General Tips
- If they send a friend request to your alt, accept it. Unless you have good reason not to. 
- Listening to music while recruiting helps.
- Make alts regularly. You never know when one or more may be murdered by the Discord algorithm.
- Be friendly, but use correct spelling, grammar, and capitalization. Professionalism is important. 
- Don't DM people who have anything but the most nooby role(s).
- Don't DM people with more than 50 messages.
  - 100 if things are desperate.  

### Roblox
- Mention that we have Roblox events regularly.
- Roblox Verify is amazing, Islands is very good.
  - Blox Fruits and Jailbreak are good.
 - Have a Roblox alt ready specifically for recruiting.
  - If they ask to friend you on your Discord Alt's DMs, friend them on your Roblox alt. Unless you have reason not to.

### Minecraft
- Most recruiting should be done on either MC Main chat or MC looking to play.
  - MC Earth and MC Dungeons are decent backup options.

### Other Games
- Adopt your script for the specific game.

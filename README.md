## Interacting on main
As Staff, you are expected to interact with other people, troops and staff alike, on main chat.

Some tips for doing so optimally are...
- Don't let any troop feel ignored. Even saying hi and/or how are you goes a long way.
  - Make sure to say hi/bye to troops when they leave.
### Muting
- The syntax for muting is !mute username length of time reason (optional)
  -Ex: !mute @Blushock 5m spamming
- Give plenty of warning before you mute.
- Always mute on a timer. As humans, we are naturally forgetful, and doing so on a timer works around this.
